Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description
This project is created to show-case my front-end skills in web development.
It aims to provide an avenue for prospective employers to see some of the projects I have done so that they can rate my skill-set and probably call me up for a job placement.
In this project, I learnt how to build a front-end project using the necessary skills such as HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The project helps to expand my knowledge in those areas where I need to advance my strength and the abi;ity to use several components when it comes to using the Bootstrap framework.

The project is a single responsive portfolio webpage which has which has five(5) links, the "Responsive Designs", "What I Do", "Project Slide", "Project List", "Contact Me" which are the major sections in this project, including the Hero section at the top, immediately after the links.
